# Statistics

Statistics is a collection of methods for collecting, displaying, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data.
> __Statistics is everywhere:__
>
>- Weather Prediction
>- USD Prediction
>- ANOVA
>- Un employment rate fallen
>- etc
>
> __Language of Statistics:__
>
> - __Average__ income in Pakistan
> - Highest __(Maximum)__ score in criket match
> - 40% __(Percentage)__ teachers in Pakistan are female
> - Dollar kabhi uper jata hy kabhi neechay __(Varience)__
> - Hostels main larkay zaida kharcha kartay hyn __(t-test)__
> - Faislabad > Lahore > Karachi had jugtain ke ranking __(ANOVA)__
>
>__Types of Data__
>
> 1. Cross Sectional Data
>       - Data collected at one point
> 2. Time Series Data
>       - Data Collected over different time points
> 3. Univariate
>       - Data contains a single variable to measure entity e.g:
>           1. Plant Height
> 4. Multi Variate
>       - Data contains > 2 variables to measure something e.g:
>           1. Plant Height
>           2. Fertilizer Amount
>           3. Irrigation Time
>
>__Types of Variables__
>
>   1. Categorical (Nominal)
>       1. Binomial (True or False)
>       2. Multinomial (multiple choices e.g. how to go to office)
>       3. Ordinal Variable: Data ranked or ordered (mery pass kitny phone hain?, categories can be compared)
>   2. Ratio Data:
>        1. Data have a natural zero, Measurement in units and ratios are continuos variable
>   3. Interval Variable / Data:
>       1. ordered and characterized data
>
>__Measure of Central Tendency__
>
>1. Mean:
>       - Average, meaningful for inteval and ratio data
>       - Outliers: change the mean of a data, therefore median is useful
> 2. Median:
>       - Middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers
> 3. Mode:
>       - The value that occurs most frequently
>
>__Measure of Dispersion__
>
>   1. Dispersion:
>       - How much data spread around mean
>   2. Standard Deviation (std)
>       - __Mean__ with a __SD__ is more useful than only Mean by itself
>   3. Standard Error (se)
>   4. Variance
>   5. Bell Curve
>
>__Fundamentals of Visualization__
>
>Type of variable depends on the variable type
>
> 1. Categorical Variable: Qualitative (No numerical meaning)
>       - Counts (plot type)
>       - Male vs Female
>       - True vs False
>       - 0 vs 1
>       - Yes vs NO
> 2. Continuous Variable: Quantitative Numerical (mostly represented in numbers)
>       - Scatter plot
>       - Statistical Proportions (means and their comparison)
